    このサイトで公開しているモジュール等のライセンスについて


    ネット上にアップしたものについてアレコレ主張するのはナンセンスなことだと思っていますんで、まるまるパクって「私が作りましたぁ！」って主張するような非常識なことを除けば、基本的に非商用・商用を問わずにご自由にそのままあるいは必要に応じてご自身で修正を施したものをご利用ください。また、その際にご利用になったモジュール等を利用していることを明記する必要などもありませんし、再配布などもご自由にして頂いて構いませんです、はい。

    ...ただし、ご利用は自己責任においてお願いします。また、別途ライセンスに関して明記してある場合はそちらを優先するものとしますです。

    Translation:

    "It is my belief that it is a nonsense to claim a license on a product
    which is released on the web, but as long as proper attribution is done
    to the original author, you can use for commercial or non-commercial
    purposes, with or without modifications. There is no need to advertise
    the use of this module, and reditribution is allowed. However, please use
    at your own risk. Also, if there are license statements, they take
    precedence"
