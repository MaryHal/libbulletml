bulletml (0.0.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bulletml depended on Boost just to get boost::shared_ptr. Patched it to
    use std::tr1::shared_ptr instead, so this dependency can be dropped.
    + This caused an API change (not affecting any package in Debian), so
      bumped the soname.
  * Added a watch file.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.1.
    + debian/rules: Renamed 'configure' target to 'patch'.
